Preprocesses an input drone or satellite image  to prepare it for the neural network system (`image_matching_system.py`). The preprocessing steps include resizing the image to 224x224 pixels, normalizing pixel values to [0,1], and converting to CHW (channels, height, width) format, which is required for PyTorch-based neural network inference. The script is using minimal dependencies (Pillow and NumPy) and assumes the input image is a standard RGB image (e.g., 640x480 for drone images or 2000x2000 for satellite tiles).

### Explanation of the Code
- **Purpose**: Preprocesses a drone or satellite image (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TIFF) to match the input requirements of the neural network in `image_matching_system.py` (224x224 pixels, normalized to [0,1], CHW format).
- **Steps**:
  - **Load Image**: Uses PILâ€™s `Image.open` to load the image and converts to RGB to ensure consistency (handles PNG, JPEG, TIFF).
  - **Resize**: Resizes to 224x224 pixels using the LANCZOS resampling method for high quality.
  - **Normalize**: Converts pixel values to [0,1] by dividing by 255, using `np.float32` for PyTorch compatibility.
  - **Convert to CHW**: Transposes the array from HWC (height, width, channels) to CHW (channels, height, width) using `np.transpose`.
  - **Optional Save**: Saves the preprocessed array as a `.npy` file if an output path is provided.
- **Error Handling**: Catches errors (e.g., invalid file, unsupported format) and prints clear messages.
- **Output**: Returns a NumPy array (shape: [3, 224, 224]) ready for the neural network. Optionally saves it as a `.npy` file.
