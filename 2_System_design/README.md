# Asignment 
2. System design
- Design an NN-based system that:
- takes a camera image similar to whatâ€™s generated by the program above
- has access to at least 100 satellite images (each is a 1km^2 tile)
- matches this image to specific coordinates on a specific tile
- the system must run in real time on RPi5 or equivalent
- this part is very free-form, it can be one end-to-end NN, or several neural networks, with any kind of additional modules as needed.
- For the neural network(s)
  * write prototype-level Pytorch models/modules code.
 * it should cover the model architecture, and loss computation
 * it does not have to actually work/run/train, some parts that are not related to architecture/loss can be skipped
* Instead of python/pytorch code you can just write a detailed description of the NN(s) architectures, losses, and other details

Bonus points for:
- the neural network(s) are fully implemented and work (given weights and dataset(s))
- training can at least overfit to a single data point
