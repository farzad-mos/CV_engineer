🚁 Lendurai Computer Vision Engineer Assignments 📸🛰️
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Lendurai Computer Vision Engineer job assignments! 🚁 This project showcases two exciting tasks I tackled to demonstrate my skills in computer vision and machine learning for autonomous drone systems. With a dash of code and a sprinkle of creativity, I built tools to make drones see the world like never before! 📸 Here’s a quick peek at what’s inside, with a fun drone-themed twist! 🛰️

Assignment 1: Drone Camera Simulator 🚁

Built a C++ program using OpenCV to transform a satellite image into a drone’s-eye view, given coordinates, altitude, and tilt angle. It’s like giving a drone a pair of high-tech glasses to see the world from above! 📸 Includes bonus features like wintery snow effects and thermal camera vibes. 🛰️


Assignment 2: Neural Network Image Matcher 📸

Designed a PyTorch neural network to match a drone image to one of 100+ satellite tiles and pinpoint exact coordinates, optimized for real-time performance on a Raspberry Pi 5. Think of it as a drone’s GPS brain, finding its place on the map with a snap! 🚁 Bonus: It can learn from a single image, like a super-smart drone student. 🛰️



This repo includes Python scripts for preprocessing (image resizing, coordinate normalization) to support both assignments, all wrapped in clear code and documentation. It’s my way of showing Lendurai how I can help drones navigate and explore with vision-powered precision! 🚁📸🛰️ Check out the code, manuals, and reports to see the magic in action!
